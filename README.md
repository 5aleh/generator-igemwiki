# generator-igemwiki

This tool is heavily inspired by Julian Mazzitelli's (iGEM Toronto 2016) [generator-igemwiki](https://github.com/igemuoftATG/generator-igemwiki), builds on much of his work, and is an attempt at providing a stable and easily community-maintained package.

## Description

`generator-igemwiki` is a [Yeoman generator](http://yeoman.io/); a tool that creates scaffolds for iGEM Wikis using Virginia 2018's wiki build tool, [igem-wikibrick](https://github.com/Virginia-iGEM/igem-wikibrick).

In english: `generator-igemwiki` makes creating a professional, high-quality iGEM Wiki quickly and easily. The tool provides you with a highly flexible template that can be edited locally and offline; changes are rendered instantly in your web browser, and all files can be uploaded automatically to the iGEM wiki.

Depending on experience level and ambition, different extensions to the scaffold are available which can bring teams closer to their goal. The most simple scaffold uses pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and regular old images and fonts. We've added optional extensions such as Handlebars which can be used for pre-publish templating, and vendor packages like JQuery which can be used for live templating. Frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma and Material can be added on that can simplify the process of web development for those who are new to programming. Preprocessors and postprocessors can be added such as SASS, Autoprefixer and minifiers that make writing clean, readable code faster.
